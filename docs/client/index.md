### Server mods in singleplayer

To run server mods in singleplayer you need the [ServerLaunchFix](https://v-rising.thunderstore.io/package/Mythic/ServerLaunchFix/) mod. The reason is that even when you're playing singleplayer, the game launches a server for you in the background, and this server will not have the mods you have installed on your client by default. the [ServerLaunchFix](https://v-rising.thunderstore.io/package/Mythic/ServerLaunchFix/) mod ensures that all mods you have on the client exist on your local server
